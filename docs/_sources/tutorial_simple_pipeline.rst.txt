Tutorial: A Simple Pipeline
---------------------------

The following illustrates how a pipeline like the one above is built using
``gunpowder``. We will build the pipeline incrementally and see what effect
each change has. Therefore, this tutorial is best read in that order.
Nevertheless, feel free to jump ahead to any of the following topics we are
covering here:

To rerun the example given here yourself, have a look at the
following preliminaries (or simply head over to this tutorial's
`Colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gyks3PYsD4xUZkwVzuXGPIYdr59fEYNa#scrollTo=-m4wLcJNIv6A>`_):

.. admonition:: Tutorial Preliminaries: Data Preparation and Helpers
  :class: toggle

  To follow the example here, install those packages::

    pip install gunpowder
    pip install zarr
    pip install matplotlib

  .. jupyter-execute::

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    import random
    import zarr
    from skimage import data
    from skimage import filters

    # make sure we all see the same
    np.random.seed(19623)
    random.seed(19623)

    # open a sample image (channels first)
    raw_data = data.astronaut().transpose(2, 0, 1)

    # create some dummy "ground-truth" to train on
    gt_data = filters.gaussian(raw_data[0], sigma=3.0) > 0.75
    gt_data = gt_data[np.newaxis,:].astype(np.float32)

    # store image in zarr container
    f = zarr.open('sample_data.zarr', 'w')
    f['raw'] = raw_data
    f['raw'].attrs['resolution'] = (1, 1)
    f['ground_truth'] = gt_data
    f['ground_truth'].attrs['resolution'] = (1, 1)

    # helper function to show image(s), channels first
    def imshow(raw, ground_truth=None, prediction=None):
      rows = 1
      if ground_truth is not None:
        rows += 1
      if prediction is not None:
        rows += 1
      cols = raw.shape[0] if len(raw.shape) > 3 else 1
      fig, axes = plt.subplots(rows, cols, figsize=(10, 4), sharex=True, sharey=True, squeeze=False)
      if len(raw.shape) == 3:
        axes[0][0].imshow(raw.transpose(1, 2, 0))
      else:
        for i, im in enumerate(raw):
          axes[0][i].imshow(im.transpose(1, 2, 0))
      row = 1
      if ground_truth is not None:
        if len(ground_truth.shape) == 3:
          axes[row][0].imshow(ground_truth[0])
        else:
          for i, gt in enumerate(ground_truth):
            axes[row][i].imshow(gt[0])
        row += 1
      if prediction is not None:
        if len(prediction.shape) == 3:
          axes[row][0].imshow(prediction[0])
        else:
          for i, gt in enumerate(prediction):
            axes[row][i].imshow(gt[0])
      plt.show()

The data we are working with is shown below. It is stored in a ``zarr``
container ``sample_data.zarr`` in dataset called ``raw``, which has one
attribute ``resolution = (1, 1)``:

.. jupyter-execute::

  imshow(zarr.open('sample_data.zarr')['raw'][:])

.. note::

  The ``resolution`` attribute in the zarr dataset will be read by
  ``gunpowder``. ``gunpowder`` supports anisotropic resultions and even
  datasets with different resolutions in the same pipeline. Here, it tells
  ``gunpowder`` that this is a 2D dataset, with the remaining dimension to be
  interpreted as channels. More on this later.

.. _sub_minimal_pipeline:

A minimal pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step for every pipeline is to declare the **arrays** that will be
used. For now, we will need only one array which we call ``raw``:

.. jupyter-execute::

  import gunpowder as gp

  # declare arrays to use in the pipeline
  raw = gp.ArrayKey('RAW')

Next we assemble the pipeline itself. To illustrate how ``gunpowder`` works, we
will do this step by step and look at the changes each step introduces. We
start with a "pipeline" consisting only of a data source.

.. jupyter-execute::

  # create "pipeline" consisting only of a data source
  source = gp.ZarrSource(
      'sample_data.zarr',  # the zarr container
      {raw: 'raw'},  # which dataset to associate to the array key
      {raw: gp.ArraySpec(interpolatable=True)}  # meta-information
  )
  pipeline = source

The pipeline by itself does nothing until we request data from it. What exactly
is requested is specified by a :class:`BatchRequest`. The following shows how
to create a request for "raw" data, starting at ``(0, 0)`` with a size of
``(64, 64)``.

.. jupyter-execute::

  # formulate a request for "raw"
  request = gp.BatchRequest()
  request[raw] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (64, 64))

The request behaves like a dictionary, mapping each array key to a region of
interest (ROI), i.e., an offset and a size.

It remains to **build** the pipeline and request a :class:`Batch`:

.. jupyter-execute::

  # build the pipeline...
  with gp.build(pipeline):

    # ...and request a batch
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  # show the content of the batch
  print(f"batch returned: {batch}")
  imshow(batch[raw].data)

The returned batch contains a crop of the source image, located in the top left
corner. This is indeed exactly what we requested, as an inspection of our
request reveals:

.. jupyter-execute::

  print(request)

As we can see, the request for ``RAW`` (the name we gave to our array key) is
for a ROI that begins at 0 and ends at 64 for each dimension, giving it a shape
of ``(64, 64)``. The :class:`ZarrSource` simply delivered on exactly this
request.

.. admonition:: Further Example: Change Request Offset
  :class: toggle

  To create a request for data in a specific area of the source, we simply
  change the offset in the request :class:`Roi`:

  .. jupyter-execute::

    request[raw] = gp.Roi((50, 150), (64, 64))
    #                     ^^^^^^^^^
    #                     changed offset

    with gp.build(pipeline):
      batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

    print(f"batch returned: {batch}")
    imshow(batch[raw].data)

Random samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In training pipelines, however, it might be useful to randomly select a
location to crop data from. Doing this manually by changing the offset of the
ROI in the request we send for every iteration would be cumbersome. It would
also require that we know the size of the data in the source.

Instead, ``gunpowder`` provides a node :class:`RandomLocation` that does that
for us, we simply have to add it to our pipeline:

.. jupyter-execute::

  # add a RandomLocation node to the pipeline to randomly select a sample

  random_location = gp.RandomLocation()
  pipeline = source + random_location

  print(pipeline)

When we now issue the same request, it will first be shifted by
``random_location`` to a random location *within* the provided data.

.. jupyter-execute::

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data)

This example illustrates two important concepts in ``gunpowder``:

1. Request can (and will be) changed as they are passed upstream through the
   pipeline. In this example, :class:`RandomLocation` changes the offset of the
   request for us, such that we get data from a random location.
2. ``gunpowder`` nodes know what kind of data is provided upstream, and what
   its extents are. Here, :class:`RandomLocation` uses this information to find
   out where it can safely shift the request to.

Geometric augmentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``gunpowder`` provides many more nodes to be added to a pipeline, most of them
tailored towards training pipelines. The following example shows how to add
simple random *mirror* and *transpose* augmentations:

.. jupyter-execute::

  simple_augment = gp.SimpleAugment()
  pipeline = source + random_location + simple_augment

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data)

The :class:`SimpleAugment` node will (by default) randomly mirror and/or
transpose batches passing through it. Notably, the transpose operation is
transparent, i.e., if we were to request data in a non-square ROI, we will
still get the size we asked for, transposed or not:

.. jupyter-execute::

  request[raw] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (64, 128))

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data)

Simple augmentations like this are complemented by random rotations and elastic
deformations, which are provided by the :class:`ElasticAugment` node:

.. jupyter-execute::

  import math

  elastic_augment = gp.ElasticAugment(
    control_point_spacing=(16, 16),
    jitter_sigma=(4.0, 4.0),
    rotation_interval=(0, math.pi/2))
  pipeline = source + random_location + simple_augment + elastic_augment

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data)

Intensity augmentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Intensity values can be modified and random noise added in a similar fashion:

.. jupyter-execute::

  normalize = gp.Normalize(raw)
  intensity_augment = gp.IntensityAugment(
    raw,
    scale_min=0.8,
    scale_max=1.2,
    shift_min=-0.2,
    shift_max=0.2)
  noise_augment = gp.NoiseAugment(raw)

  pipeline = (
    source +
    normalize +
    random_location +
    simple_augment +
    elastic_augment +
    intensity_augment +
    noise_augment)

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data)

We introduced two new concepts in this snippet:

First, we added a :class:`Normalize` node for ``raw``. This node ensures that
the data type of the given array is ``np.float`` from there on through the
pipeline. We have so far been agnostic about the exact datatype of ``raw`` (it
was ``uint8``, by the way). However, in order to shift intensities and to add
random noise, it is helpful to ensure we are dealing with float values between
0 and 1. The normalization applied by :class:`Normalize` is data independent,
it is based on the data type of the source (or, optionally, on a user-specified
scaling factor).

Second, we introduced nodes that take array keys as arguments
(:class:`Normalize`, :class:`IntensityAugment`, and :class:`NoiseAugment`).
Those nodes limit their operation to the given keys, which is useful if our
batch also contains other arrays (like a ground-truth segmentation) that we do
not wish to modify.

Creating batches with multiple samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So far we have seen how to request a single sample in a "batch". Normally,
however, batches consist of several samples drawn independently. This can be
done using the :class:`Stack` node:

.. jupyter-execute::

  stack = gp.Stack(5)
  pipeline = (
    source +
    normalize +
    random_location +
    simple_augment +
    elastic_augment +
    intensity_augment +
    noise_augment +
    stack)

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data)

Requesting multiple arrays
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To train a model on data, we need a training signal as well. This signal can
come, for example, in the form of a binary segmentation stored alongside the
raw image data. For this tutorial, we will assume that such a binary
segmentation exists and is stored in the same ``zarr`` container in a dataset
called ``ground_truth``. At the beginning of this tutorial, we created a dummy
segmentation to work with:

.. jupyter-execute::

  imshow(
    zarr.open('sample_data.zarr')['raw'][:],
    zarr.open('sample_data.zarr')['ground_truth'][:])

With a slight modification to the source node and our request, we can now
simultaneously request raw data and a segmentation:

.. jupyter-execute::

  gt = gp.ArrayKey('GROUND_TRUTH')

  source = gp.ZarrSource(
      'sample_data.zarr',
      {
        raw: 'raw',
        gt: 'ground_truth'
      },
      {
        raw: gp.ArraySpec(interpolatable=True),
        gt: gp.ArraySpec(interpolatable=False)
      })

  request[gt] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (64, 128))

  pipeline = (
    source +
    normalize +
    random_location +
    simple_augment +
    elastic_augment +
    intensity_augment +
    noise_augment +
    stack)

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data, batch[gt].data)

As we can see, our batch does now contain aligned data for both ``raw`` and
``gt``. Notably, both arrays have been transformed in the same way as they were
passed through the pipeline, except for the intensity augmentation parts that
were exclusive to ``raw``. This works even if the requested ROIs for ``raw``
and ``gt`` are not identical. Here we see the effect of requesting a
ground-truth ROI that is offset relative to the raw ROI:

.. jupyter-execute::

  # request an offset ROI for ground-truth
  odd_request = request.copy()
  odd_request[gt] = gp.Roi((20, 20), (64, 128))

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(odd_request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data, batch[gt].data)

This highlights another feature of ``gunpowder``: Requests can contain ROIs
with different offsets and sizes. Internally, ``gunpowder`` will figure out
what areas in the source have to be read to satisfy those heterogeneous
requests, and will only read as much as needed to satisfy the request. This is
useful in many applications where ground-truth is not needed for the whole
input image (e.g., because of the use of valid convolutions in neural networks
and the correspondingly smaller network output).

.. admonition:: Further Example: Multiple Sources
  :class: toggle

  For now we assumed that both arrays we are interested in (``raw`` and ``gt``)
  are read from the same source, i.e., they are stored in the same ``zarr``
  container in this example. This might not always be the case. ``gunpowder``
  allows you to have multiple sources for different arrays and merge them
  together into one. The following example shows this functionality:

  .. jupyter-execute::

    source_raw = gp.ZarrSource(
        'sample_data.zarr',
        {raw: 'raw'},
        {raw: gp.ArraySpec(interpolatable=True)}
    )
    source_gt = gp.ZarrSource(
        'sample_data.zarr',
        {gt: 'ground_truth'},
        {gt: gp.ArraySpec(interpolatable=False)}
    )
    combined_source = (source_raw, source_gt) + gp.MergeProvider()

    pipeline = (
      combined_source +
      normalize +
      random_location +
      simple_augment +
      elastic_augment +
      intensity_augment +
      noise_augment +
      stack)

    with gp.build(pipeline):
      batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

    imshow(batch[raw].data, batch[gt].data)

Training a network
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have seen so far how ``gunpowder`` can be used to generate training batches.
In the following we will see how to train a neural network directly in this
pipeline. For the example, we will train a 2D U-Net (``model``) on the binary
ground-truth using a binary cross-entropy loss (``loss``). We will use `PyTorch
<https://pytorch.org/>`_, but the same can be done with a `TensorFlow
<https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ model as well.

.. admonition:: Training Preliminaries: Create Model, Loss, and Optimizer
  :class: toggle

  We will use the U-Net implemention from `funlib.learn.torch
  <https://github.com/funkelab/funlib.learn.torch>`_, but any PyTorch model can
  be used. To follow the example, install those packages::

    pip install git+https://github.com/funkelab/funlib.learn.torch@fe60a7d9a375d64208266f96a739ab01f62a0c78
    pip install torch

  Here, we create a very simple 2D U-Net mapping from three channels (RGB of
  the raw data) to one channel (the segmentation output). The U-Net has two
  downsampling modules, downsampling isotropically with a factor of two. We use
  'same' padding here, meaning that the output size of the U-Net will be the
  same as the input size. The number of feature maps will be four in the
  top-most level of the U-Net, and increase with a factor of two for each of
  the two following levels. The output of the U-Net is further passed through a
  sigmoid function to ensure values are between 0 and 1.

  .. jupyter-execute::

    import torch
    from funlib.learn.torch.models import UNet

    # make sure we all see the same
    torch.manual_seed(18)

    unet = UNet(
      in_channels=3,
      num_fmaps=4,
      fmap_inc_factor=2,
      downsample_factors=[[2, 2], [2, 2]],
      kernel_size_down=[[[3, 3], [3, 3]]]*3,
      kernel_size_up=[[[3, 3], [3, 3]]]*2,
      num_fmaps_out=1,
      padding='same')

    model = torch.nn.Sequential(unet, torch.nn.Sigmoid())

    loss = torch.nn.BCELoss()

    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters())

Training itself is implemented in a ``gunpowder`` node, in this case
:class:`torch.Train`. The main benefit of using this node in a
``gunpowder`` pipeline (compared to just taking the batches we requested so far
and feeding them manually to the model) is that the output of the network
itself can be mapped to a ``gunpowder`` array, and subsequently be used in the
pipeline. In the following, we will create a new array key ``prediction`` to do
exactly that:

.. jupyter-execute::

  # create new array key for the network output
  prediction = gp.ArrayKey('PREDICTION')

  # create a train node using our model, loss, and optimizer
  train = gp.torch.Train(
    model,
    loss,
    optimizer,
    inputs = {
      'input': raw
    },
    loss_inputs = {
      0: prediction,
      1: gt
    },
    outputs = {
      0: prediction
    })

  pipeline = (
    source +
    normalize +
    random_location +
    simple_augment +
    elastic_augment +
    intensity_augment +
    noise_augment +
    stack +
    train)

  # add the prediction to the request
  request[prediction] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (64, 128))

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data, batch[gt].data, batch[prediction].data)

As we can see, our batch does now contain an array ``prediction``, which is the
output of the :class:`torch.Train` node. This illustrates another feature of
``gunpowder``: Arrays can be generated by any node, this functionality is not
limited to source nodes (and in fact, source nodes are in no way special, they
are simply ``gunpowder`` nodes that do not require an input and provide an
array).

But the train node above did not just produce a prediction: Since we also told
it which loss and optimizer to use, and since we linked the output of our
network and the ground-truth to the loss via ``loss_inputs``, the train node
did also perform a training iteration for us. This becomes more evident if we
keep training for a few iterations:

.. jupyter-execute::

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    for i in range(1000):
      batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data, batch[gt].data, batch[prediction].data)

.. note::

  The predictions are only included in the batch because we requested them here
  to visualize them. To keep the example simple, we request the predictions in
  every iteration. In a production setting, however, it is advisable to request
  only what is needed for each iteration. This saves a potentially expensive
  copy from GPU memory.

Predicting on a whole image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``gunpowder`` and its pipeline concept can not just be used for training, but
also to perform the final predictions once training is finished. The following
example shows how to assemble a pipeline to take the model we just trained and
apply it on the whole image. The main difficulty in doing that is that the
model was trained for a particular input size. Consequently, the whole image
will have to be chunked into pieces of the correct size, and the network has to
be applied to each chunk in a scanning fashion, creating predictions one chunk
at a time. Those chunks then have to be reassembled into a prediction for the
whole image. This whole procedure is orchestrated by another ``gunpowder``
node: :class:`Scan`.

.. jupyter-execute::

  # set model into evaluation mode
  model.eval()

  predict = gp.torch.Predict(
    model,
    inputs = {
      'input': raw
    },
    outputs = {
      0: prediction
    })

  stack = gp.Stack(1)

  # request matching the model input and output sizes
  scan_request = gp.BatchRequest()
  scan_request[raw] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (64, 128))
  scan_request[prediction] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (64, 128))

  scan = gp.Scan(scan_request)

  pipeline = (
    source +
    normalize +
    stack +
    predict +
    scan)

  # request for raw and prediction for the whole image
  request = gp.BatchRequest()
  request[raw] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (512, 512))
  request[prediction] = gp.Roi((0, 0), (512, 512))

  with gp.build(pipeline):
    batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

  imshow(batch[raw].data, None, batch[prediction].data)

The main difference to the training pipeline used earlier is that there is no
longer a need for data augmentation. We also replaced the :class:`torch.Train`
node with its equivalent :class:`torch.Predict`.

.. admonition:: Further Example: Prediction in Large nD Arrays
  :class: toggle

  Here, we make a request to :class:`Scan` for the whole image and the
  prediction. This is fine as long as both arrays are small enough to fit into
  memory. However, ``gunpowder`` was designed to work with arbitrarily large
  nD arrays. Therefore, :class:`Scan` accepts empty requests as well, which
  will still result in small ``scan_request`` s being performed in a scanning
  fashion over the whole input range--the only difference is that :class:`Scan`
  does not keep the individual results and consequently that the batch returned
  by :class:`Scan` will be empty.

  So how do we get access to the prediction then to store it, for example, in a
  ``zarr`` container? The answer is to add a node **between** predict and scan,
  through which every batch will pass before it is being discarded. The
  :class:`ZarrWrite` node will, for instance, assemble a ``zarr`` container of
  all the arrays passing through it.

  The following example illustrates that:

  .. jupyter-execute::

    # prepare the zarr dataset to write to
    f = zarr.open('sample_data.zarr')
    ds = f.create_dataset('prediction', shape=(1, 1, 512, 512))
    ds.attrs['resolution'] = (1, 1)
    ds.attrs['offset'] = (0, 0)

    # create a zarr write node to store the predictions
    zarr_write = gp.ZarrWrite(
      output_filename='sample_data.zarr',
      dataset_names={
        prediction: 'prediction'
      })

    pipeline = (
      source +
      normalize +
      stack +
      predict +
      zarr_write +
      scan)

    # request an empty batch from scan
    request = gp.BatchRequest()

    with gp.build(pipeline):
      batch = pipeline.request_batch(request)

    print(batch)
    imshow(
      zarr.open('sample_data.zarr')['raw'][:],
      None,
      zarr.open('sample_data.zarr')['prediction'][:])

What next?
^^^^^^^^^^

``gunpowder`` provides much more nodes to chain together, including a
:ref:`pre-cache<sec_api_precache>` node for easy parallel fetching of batches,
several :ref:`augmentation nodes<sec_api_augmentation_nodes>`, and nodes for
:ref:`profiling<sec_api_profiling>` and :ref:`inspection<sec_api_snapshot>`.
For a complete list see the :ref:`API reference<sec_api>`.
