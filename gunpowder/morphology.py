    '''Enlarge existing regions in a binary map.

    Args:

        binary_map (numpy array):

            A matrix with zeros, in which regions to be enlarged are indicated
            with a 1 (regions can already represent larger areas).

        radius (``ndarray`` of ``float``):

            The amount by which to enlarge forground objects in world units.

        voxel_size (tuple, list or numpy array):

            Indicates the physical voxel size of the binary_map.

        ring_fraction (``float``, optional):

            If set, instead of just enlargin objects, a ring is grown around
            them (and the objects removed). The thickness of the ring is set
            with this parameter as a fraction of the radius.

        in_place (bool, optional):

            If set to ``True``, argument ``binary_map`` will be modified
            directly.

    Returns:

        A matrix with 0s and 1s of same dimension as input binary_map with
        enlarged regions (indicated with 1), unless ``in_place`` is set.
