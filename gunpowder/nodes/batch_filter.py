class BatchFilter(BatchProvider):
    '''Convenience wrapper for :class:`BatchProviders<BatchProvider>` with
    exactly one input provider.

    By default, a node of this class will expose the same :class:`ProviderSpec`
    as the upstream provider. You can modify the provider spec by calling
    :func:`provides` and :func:`updates` in :func:`setup`.

    Subclasses need to implement at least :func:`process` to modify a passed
    batch (downstream). Optionally, the following methods can be implemented:

        :func:`setup`

            Initialize this filter. Called after setup of the DAG. All upstream 
            providers will be set up already.

        :func:`teardown`

            Destruct this filter, free resources, stop worker processes.

        :func:`prepare`

            Prepare for a batch request. Always called before each 
            :func:`process`. Used to communicate dependencies.
